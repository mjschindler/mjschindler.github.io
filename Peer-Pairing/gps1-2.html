           <h3>What is Pair Programming?</h3>
           <p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">Wikipedia</a>, pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work as a pair together on one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.</p>

                      Don't type passively

                    <li>
                      Say what you are about to do

                    <li>
                      Ask for an implementation idea
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Ask for a better way to solve the problem at hand

                      Bring up alternative ideas
