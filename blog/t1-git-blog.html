      So, here's what you've been waiting for, dear reader. Here's my first blog post written for a Dev Bootcamp assignment. And here are the topics we've been assigned to address:
      <br>
      <blockquote>
        This week you've learned a bit about the command line and gotten more familiar with Git and GitHub. Now it's your turn to write a blog to introduce these concepts to other beginners. Be sure to think about:
        <ol>
          <li>What are the benefits of version control?</li>
          <li>How does git help you keep track of changes?</li>
          <li>Why use GitHub to store your code?</li>
        </ol>
      </blockquote>

Diving into Dev Bootcamp this week has been interesting, but tough. We've been introduced to a lot of new rules and tools. It will take time for me to get used to juggling the part-time coursework with my existing schedule. And re-learning the command line has been a challenge. (Going through our assignments this week made me remember something: it's been about 8 years since I last used the terminal with any regularity. I worked with it every day when I was an IT intern during college, but I guess its one of those "use it or lose it" things for me.) But already, some of the lessons have started to click, which is exciting.

    I've read about git and GitHub, but have never used them before this class. Git is a type of version control software. Version control systems keep track of what changes are made to a file or project. They also record when those changes were made. Then you can look back over each change — each version of the file or project — and see all the modifications that have happened.
</p>
    When you’re working on a coding project, Git keeps track of what changes you make to a file and when you make them. GitHub is an online platform that uses Git to connect and keep track of all the changes that not just you, but also lots of other GitHub users, may make to different coding projects.  It enables many people to work on the same project without losing, confusing, or overwriting each person’s work.
    </p>
    <p>
Developers use git's version control so that more than one person can simultaneously work on and combine changes to one file without deleting, duplicating, or overwriting each other’s work. Have you ever worked on a group project that requires you to each write portions of a report and then combine them into one document? Maybe you had to send the main document around via email and allow everyone to add their work to it. But one person added the same paragraph twice. Someone else changed your spelling of the word “onomatopoeia”  to “anamatapia.” Someone else forgot to save their file as a new version so then you had TWO documents with the same name floating around and no one knew which one was the right one. Well, if you had version control on that document, you would never have to suffer that kind of confusion and frustration again. With git’s version control, teams of developers can avoid it as well.
