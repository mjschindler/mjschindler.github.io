      Between the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files">Snowden revelations</a> and the increasing number of <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/">high-profile hacks</a> we've seen lately, it should have become obvious to even the most Pollyanna-minded observer that maintaining individual privacy and user security should be one of our primary goals. As one of my <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/27/investing/cybersecurity-stocks-hack/">search results for "hack"</a> suggests, people and organizations have finally begun to act on their privacy and security concerns in earnest. That's one reason why cybersecurity stocks are so hot right now.
    </p>
      <blockquote>Cybersecurity stocks aren't just rallying due to headlines. All these hacks have legitimately boosted their business. </blockquote>
      <p>
        So, besides picking up a share or two of a sexy security ETF, what can you do to make the world safer from destructive hacks?
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Build for Privacy and Security First</h3>
        Forget the <a href="http://www.thewire.com/technology/2013/03/somolo-fever-has-finally-broken-sxsw/62890/">so-mo-lo trend</a>. Instead of thinking about social first, mobile first, or local first design, you should think about privacy and security first.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may think you're safe from attack if you're a small player, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/22/security-for-startups-in-10-steps/">but you're not</a>.
        <blockquote>Some increasingly common attacks — like DDoS extortion — specifically target smaller, more vulnerable businesses, whose loose cowboy cultures, shallow security expertise, fragile infrastructure and fresh capital make for easy pickings.</blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're building a tech start-up, you may be <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/23/technology/startup-cyberattack/">particularly at risk</a>.
        <blockquote>"Startups are incredibly vulnerable to cyberattacks in their first 18 months," said Brian Burch, vice president with Symantec. "If a business thinks that it's too small to matter to cybercriminals, then it's fooling itself with a false sense of security."</blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>
        So, how do you build your cutting-edge application or game-changing business with privacy and security in mind from the get-go? Here are a few simple suggestions I've gleaned from the internet and my own experience working with and for startups.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Imagine the worst-case scenario and plan for it.</strong> What happens if you get hacked and all your user information is shared tomorrow? How do you keep that from happening? How will you respond if it does? Put measures in place to proactively defend against attacks and recover from them if they actually happen.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <strong>Surround yourself with privacy and security resources and experts.</strong> It would be great if your technical founder is also a cybersecurity expert, but what if she isn't? Seek out friends, partners, and employees who are. For example, I have attended cybersecurity meetups and have met some brilliant, passionate security advocates who opened my eyes to new possibilities. If you can plug yourself and your startup into that community, you'll be more knowledgable and prepared for potential threats.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <strong>Only collect information from your users <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/08/08/user-data/">that you actually need</a>.</strong> I have seen many individuals and businesses try to collect as much information as possible about their customers and users without having a clear roadmap for how that data will be used. Not only can that waste valuable time and resources, but that can also create more risk for your users if you are hacked. Do you really need their credit card information? Their address? Their mother's middle name? Do you REALLY need to know where they are at all times?
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <strong>Do unto your users as you would have done unto you.</strong> How would you like your data to be handled? Would you be OK with someone selling it to the highest bidder? Would you be OK with it being stored insecurely? Would you be OK with someone at the company being able to <a href="https://medium.com/@petersimsie/can-we-trust-uber-c0e793deda36">access your location at the click of a button</a>? Don't treat your customer data any differently than you'd want yours and your family's data to be treated.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <strong>Be humble.</strong> Remember that you are not above the fray. You, your application, your business, your users, your customers -- they can all be targeted in an attack. Remember this and act accordingly, and you'll reduce your risk.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        How will you protect your privacy and security in your business -- and the rest of your life?
