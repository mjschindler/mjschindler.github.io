      In one of this week's assignments from Dev Bootcamp, we need to write a blog post that answers questions about our experience with pair programming and peer feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
      The give and take of feedback is an important part of Dev Bootcamp's teaching strategy. As students, we "must complete feedback [...] for every pairing session [...] to receive credit for it. [...] All feedback must be anonymous to protect privacy. Abstain from writing your pair's name anywhere in the free-form text to protect their privacy. Other students review each piece of feedback and rate it for kindness, actionability, and specificity. Feedback will not reach a student if it is not rated high enough on each of these measures by other students. This means that all feedback is viewed by many students, and it's important to make receiving feedback a safe and positive experience."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, here are some of my thoughts on pairing and feedback at Dev Bootcamp:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
      What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?
    </li>
      I like working with other people on these kinds of problems. When you pair with someone else, you get access to more experience and brainpower. It also makes the hours you spend staring at a screen much more fun and much less lonely. However, I have discovered that I learn the most when I pair with someone who is either very good at teaching or has a skill level that closely matches mine. If someone is highly skilled, they may solve the challenge in five minutes and leave your head spinning in perplexity.
    <li>
      Was something particularly fun or rewarding?
    </li>
      When you feel like you contributed to helping your pair solve a problem, you feel good. When you share a laugh or an a-ha moment, you feel connected to a larger community.
    <li>
      Was something frustrating and difficult for you?
    </li>
      Figuring out how to communicate with a fellow student, often a stranger, on the fly and over a chat client can be harrowing.  It's like learning to dance with a new partner. One of you has to convey how you are leading the dance, and the other has to interpret what the leading means. Even if you know the steps, this can be hard. And when you're pair programming, you're both taking turns leading and following. You are continuously absorbing and interpreting each other's ideas and intent, often under some duress because you're new to the material.  It can feel stressful to try to do all that with grace, empathy, and respect for your partner.
    <li>
      How did you feel when you read your feedback?
    </li>
      Like most mortals, my gut reaction to positive feedback is happiness and to negative feedback is unhappiness.  But my primary reaction was a mixture of confusion and relief. Relief because most of my feedback wasn't so bad, and confusion because some of my feedback left me wondering what happened. Because our feedback is supposed to be anonymous, it can be difficult to tell which pairing session it is meant for. If the feedback is too vaguely phrased, you may not be able to fully understand its context and implications. There were times when I thought, "Great! That went well... but how do I do that next time?" or "Rats! I need to improve on... wait, what am I supposed to improve on again?"
    <li>
      Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?
    </li>
      I'd say yes, somewhat. The confusion factor mentioned above makes it more difficult to glean value from the feedback, but you can parse out some good tips and lessons.
    <li>
      Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?
    </li>
      Most of my negative feedback suggests that I study the material more. I'm trying my best to do that.
    <li>
      How was it to write feedback?
    </li>
      Writing feedback can be difficult, especially when you feel that your partner doesn't have much room for improvement.
    <li>
      What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?
    </li>
      If I don't write the feedback immediately after a pairing session, I may forget to do it.
    <li>
      Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?
    </li>
      I think it can be a helpful part of the process, but I wish it were easier to get more specific feedback. As long as the feedback is anonymous and you can't be 100% certain who your pair is or what challenge it is for, it will be somewhat difficult to recall or understand its context.
