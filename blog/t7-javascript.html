      I studied this link and put its content into my own words, as much as possible: <a href="http://www.rapidprogramming.com/questions-answers/difference-between-ruby-and-javascript-ruby-vs-javascript-1477">http://www.rapidprogramming.com/questions-answers/difference-between-ruby-and-javascript-ruby-vs-javascript-1477</a>

    <p>
      Ruby is a server-side scripting and aspect oriented language. JavaScript is a client-side scripting and prototype based language.
      </p>
    <p>
Ruby syntax is simple. JavaScript syntax is comparatively complex.
</p>
    <p>
Ruby programs are slower. JavaScript programs are faster.
</p>
    <p>
When a method is called in Ruby for an incorrect object, errors will occur. In JavaScript, methods can be used to change the values of a variable.
</p>
    <p>
In Ruby, when a variable is passed to a method with the same variable name, no changes will be made to the value of the variable. Thus Ruby variables are more firm than variables in JavaScript. In JavaScript, when a variable is passed to a function with the same variable name, the value of the variable will be altered. In order to avoid these changes, the user has to explicitly fix the variable name.
</p>
    <p>
Ruby has several types of functions namely (i) blocks, (ii) procs, and (iii) lambdas. JavaScript has only one type of function and there are two ways to describe them: (i) function expressions (FE) and (ii) function declarations (FD).
</p>
    <p>
Ruby language makes use of the blocks (anonymous functions are supported in Ruby with the help of blocks). JavaScript also has blocks in the format of anonymous functions. Function operators are used for creating anonymous functions in JavaScript. Anonymous functions in JavaScript operate similar to blocks and lambdas in Ruby.
</p>
    <p>
In Ruby, there are two methods to access an array or enum objects. One of the methods is to use ‘for’ or ‘in’ loop and other method is to use iterators and block. JavaScript also includes ‘for’ or ‘in’ loop, but the loop does not operate fine on arrays.
</p>
    <p>
Iterations in Ruby are bit complex. JavaScript iterations are a bit easy.
</p>
    <p>
The methods based on strings or symbols are accessed using the send method in Ruby. In JavaScript, the objects with strings are accessed using square bracket semantics.
</p>
    <p>
In Ruby, double equals sign (= =) is used to find out if two objects are identical. In JavaScript, the triple equals (= = =) is used for finding out if two objects are identical in both value and type. The double equals sign (= =) is used in JavaScript to compare the value.
</p>
    <p>
Ruby programs have class array methods. JavaScript programs have array functions.
</p>
    <p>
Ruby supports class. JavaScript supports "prototypes" whose functionality is similar to a class in Ruby.
