Dev Bootcamp asks its students to take <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">this test</a> to discover their Gregorc thinking style.
</p>
  <p>
My results say that I'm mostly Abstract Random with a touch of Concrete Random and a speck of Abstract Linear. Nay, I have not a trace of Concrete Linear in any fiber of my being.
</p>
<p>
I take assessments like these with a huge side of salt block. Our strengths, weaknesses, personalities, and <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/talking-back/2014/07/14/neuroplasticity-new-clues-to-just-how-much-the-adult-brain-can-change/">minds can change</a> throughout our lives. Placing <a href="http://psychology.about.com/od/socialpsychology/a/person-perception.htm">people into narrow categories</a> on the basis of a questionnaire is a convenient mental shortcut. But it can also mislead, as it overlooks the complexity and plasticity within us. It's also easy for us to read personality descriptions and <a href="http://www.dumblittleman.com/2009/03/why-you-should-ignore-your-horoscope.html">believe that they apply to us even when they absolutely don't</a>. Besides, a quick glance at Wikipedia will reveal that Gregorc's peers didn't always agree that his methods:
</p>
<blockquote>
Timothy Sewall, in a comparison of four learning style assessments (Gregorc's, Myers Briggs, Kolb LSI, and an LSI by Canfield) by review of their published supporting studies (i.e., without new experimental work) concluded of Gregorc's design, "the most appropriate use of this instrument would be to provide an example of how not to construct [an] assessment tool."
</blockquote>
      <p>
However, if I had to categorize myself into one of the four options Gregorc offers, I'd say that Abstract Random seems most accurate.
</p>
<p>
I found a <a href="http://www.ieslearning.co.uk/mind.html">website</a> that lists common characteristics of Abstract Random thinkers. Here they are, with my commentary on how they apply to me.
</p>
  <p>
<strong>Abstract Random thinkers Characterizations:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>
Dislike for routine procedures and orderliness.
<br>
<i> Eh, sometimes. It depends. When it makes sense, I love a good routine.</i>
</li>
  <li>
Are extremely sensitive to his/her own and others' feelings.
<br>
<i>Gotta say, I've got a strong capacity for emphathy.</i>
</li>
  <li>
Are flexible, accepting, and responds easily to change.
<br>
<i>EXTREMELY accurate. I'm a bonafide neophile. </i>
</li>
  <li>
Learn well through discussion and sharing of ideas.
<br>
<i>YES. This is why I signed up for Dev Bootcamp instead of plugging away at learning coding on my own.</i>
</li>
  <li>
Are imaginative.
<br>
<i>Would you judge me if I told you that I still play pretend? Like, a lot?</I>
</li>
<li>
Personalize information.
<br>
<i>I'm not exactly sure what they mean here, but I take it personally. ;) </i>
</li>
  <li>
Are usually involved in many projects or interest at one time.
<br>
<i>YES YES YES. I've always got a lot of plates juggling or balls spinning and vice-versa.</i>
</li>
  <li>
Are focused on friends and relationships.
<br>
<i>I make a concerted effort to build and nurture friendships and relationships.</i>
</li>
<li>
Have a fear of not being liked.
<br>
<i>Doesn't everyone have a fear of being disliked? Isn't that part of the glue that holds society together? If we weren't afraid of rejection -- afraid that our tribe would kick us out of the cave and feed us to the sabre-toothed tiger -- we'd all act like self-indulgent jerks whenever we felt like it. OF COURSE I don't want to being disliked. But that's certainly not a crippling fear. If you don't like me, you can... well, I don't want to say what you can do, because that would be rude, and then you might dislike me. But you know what I mean.</i>
</li>
</ul>

      <figcaption>Numbers, you're lovely people, but sometimes I'd rather play with words.</figcaption>

<p>
<strong>Abstract Random thinkers tend to prefer:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>
Cooperative work
<br>
<i>As opposed to what, uncooperative work? Sure!</i>
</li>
<li>
Assignments with room for interpretation
<br>
<i>If this means I'd rather write an essay than solve a geometry problem, then yes, I'd say this is true.</i>
</li>
  <li>
Balance of social activities and work
<br>
<i>Yes. Because <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/01/top-five-regrets-of-the-dying">when you die</a>, you're not going to wish you spent more time working.</i>
</li>
  <li>
Noncompetitive atmosphere
<br>
<i>I am actually quite competitive and thrive in competitive environments. But I don't like it when competition becomes toxic.</i>
</li>
  <li>
Personalized learning
<br>
<i>Does this mean I'm a needy student?</i>
</li>
  <li>
Are given personal attention and emotional support
<br>
<i>Who wants to feel ignored and devoid of support?</i>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Abstract Random thinkers are stretched by:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>
Working alone
<br>
<i>Is this a stretch? I LOVE working alone. Or in groups. Both scenarios have their pros and cons.</i>
</li>
  <li>
Attending to details and giving exact answers
<br>
<i>I wouldn't say that, exactly. There's a lot of grey area here.</i>
</li>
  <li>
Working within time limits
<br>
<i>Eh, sometimes.</i>
</li>
<li>
Concentrating on one task at a time
<br>
<i>There's a lot going on in my head, and it all wants to come out all at once.</i>
</li>
  <li>
Being corrected
<br>
<i>I take correction pretty well, actually.</i>
</li>
  <li>
Expecting less emotional response from others
<br>
<i>I'm not sure how to interpret this one, either. I expect an emotional response from people when the situation merits an emotional response. Isn't that normal?</i>
</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
<p>
As a student at Dev Bootcamp, I am most concerned about my ability to focus on my studies and maintain enough of a work-life balance to stay happy and healthy.
</p>
  <p>
I have always, and will always, juggle lots of projects and priorities at once. The way I manage this without losing my mind or failing miserably is by siloing my efforts. I set aside blocks of time to devote to particular activities. I don't let myself switch tasks or alter my schedule without VERY reasonable cause to do so. I think this style of time management will help me complete my studies successfully and give time to recharge with my friends.
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned earlier, new research into neuroplasticity suggests that our <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">minds are capable of growing and improving</a>. As I continue my Dev Bootcamp studies, I find this idea increasingly comforting. What we're doing is really hard, and I want to whip my brain into shape and make it wrap around all the new things I'm tossing at it.
