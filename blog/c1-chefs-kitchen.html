It's a Saturday night, and usually you'd find me somewhere out in the city, hanging out with my friends. But tonight I'm at home working on my Dev Bootcamp assignments. And that's ok, because that is a sacrifice that I've decided to be willing to make.
    </p>
    <p>
I chose to enroll in Dev Bootcamp over other bootcamps, schools, courses, and methods of learning software development because I believe that its methods and culture make the most sense for my current situation. I want the hands-on, in-person learning experience. I want the physical immersion in Silicon Valley. I want the fast-paced, alley-oop into a lifetime of learning more about coding. And I want the culture, which seems to embody a lot of ideas that I value.
    </p>
    <p>
In <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef Bishay's Fireside Chat</a> video, he shares a lot of insight into Dev Bootcamp's culture. But he starts by focusing on two main ideas: Dev Bootcamp's processes are continually evolving, and every person who attends Dev Bootcamp has both a lot to learn <i>and</i> a lot to offer to the group.
    </p>
<p>
By treating the program like an "experiment," Dev Bootcamp tries to embody the ethos of the agile and lean development principles. With the spirit of an agile organization, they repeatedly mention the need for students to maintain flexibility and openess, respond rapidly to changes and feedback, and work to quickly meet course requirements. In parallel, Dev Bootcamp emphasizes lean principles, which include values like creating knowledge and respecting people. In this way, Dev Bootcamp mirrors the development strategies that many students will encounter after they graduate from the program.
</p>
<p>
They also prepare students for the diverse work environments that they will encounter post-graduation. By emphasizing empathy and appreciation for each person's contribution, Dev Bootcamp helps students hone themselves into good team players. It prepares them to work and get along with all kinds of different people with all kinds of different strengths and weaknesses.
</p>
<p>
  I appreciate these aspects of Dev Bootcamp's culture, and I'm very interested in seeing it in action as I continue the program. I'm sure I'll learn a lot, not just about software, but also about the people and organizations that create it. And for that, I can skip a few nights out with friends. They'll let me rejoin them after my work is done.
